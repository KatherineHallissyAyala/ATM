# ATM
This ATM app lets the user choose a deposit or withdrawal transaction and set the amount of the transaction.  It does not let the user overdraw their account.

# Installation
Download the html and jsx file to a directory.  In Terminal, navigate to that directory.  Run HTTP-Server in that directory.  You should see a report on where the files in the directory are running.  Navigate to that address, and open "standalone.html."

# Future Improvements
This app could be improved by allowing the user to choose what type of bills they'd like to receive when they are withdrawing funds: $100, $50, $20, etc.
