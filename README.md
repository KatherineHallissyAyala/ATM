# ATM
This ATM React app lets the user choose a deposit or withdrawal transaction and set the amount of the transaction.  It does not let the user overdraw their account.

# Installation
Download the html and jsx file to a directory.  In Terminal, navigate to that directory.  Run HTTP-Server in that directory.  You should see a report on where the files in the directory are running.  Navigate to that address, and open "standalone.html."

# Improvements I Made
I worked on the ATM app for a course.  Our instructor guided us through developing the functionality of rendering the transaction form, including deposit/withdrawal buttons, amount field, and submit button.  We also learned how to re-render the account total with each transaction.

I added to the interface on my own: I tweaked the functionality so that when a user deposits more than $100, the bank adds an extra dollar to the account total.  I included a note in the interface to convey this feature to the user.  I also added a welcome title and a customer assistance phone number.

# Future Improvements
This app could be improved by allowing the user to choose what type of bills they'd like to receive when they are withdrawing funds: $100, $50, $20, etc.
